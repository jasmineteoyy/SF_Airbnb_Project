# AF_Airbnb
UC Berkeley Data144 (Data Mining Analytics) Fall 2020 final project

## Project Overview

#### Problem Statement: 
* Simplifying the SF Airbnb Search Process: The goal is to develop a model that allows customers to find suitable Airbnb’s in the city of San Francisco based on pre-selected features such as bedrooms, neighbourhood, price and more. While the Airbnb website offers a few filters to search with, our model goes beyond filtering, exploring similarities across neighbourhoods. Customers also have the option to narrow their search based on how our model clusters Airbnb’s! 

#### Project Context & Motivation: 
* By developing a recommendation model that suggests Airbnb’s as per personal choices, we can help various types of customers select Airbnb’s from myriads of options available in San Francisco that be-fit their preferences in a more efficient manner.
* Such a recommendation tool and a user-interactive interface enables user-friendly service and attracts more customers to utilize it. 

#### The Raw Dataset:
* The datasets: listings.csv.gz & reviews.csv.gz
* They were downloaded and obtained through the Inside Airbnb website. It contains publicly sourced, cleansed and aggregated data directly from the actual Airbnb site.
