# AF_Airbnb
Project on Recommending Airbnb's for Customers

## Problem Statement: 
* Simplifying the SF Airbnb Search Process: The goal is to develop a model that allows customers to find suitable Airbnb’s in the city of San Francisco based on pre-selected features such as bedrooms, neighbourhood, price and more. While the Airbnb website offers a few filters to search with, our model goes beyond filtering, exploring similarities across neighbourhoods. Customers also have the option to narrow their search based on how our model clusters Airbnb’s!
